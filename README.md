- Clone this repository to the directory `%DRIVE%:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\AddOns\AntiFTWToolbox`, 
  - %DRIVE% is usually the C:\ drive
  - %USERNAME% is your Windows User name.
- Either restart the game, type `/reloadui` if it was running, or start the game.
- You can configure the addon by choosing messages in which channels trigger the visual indicator in the in-game ADD-ONS menu, which is accessible from the main menu.
